/*
Problem: 
> Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. The function should nd all triplets in the array that
sum up to the target sum and return a two-dimensional array of all these triplets.

Approach:
> Simplest O(n^3) for iterating for each triplet possible.
> We can have hashset + all pairs possible O(n^2) time + extra space O(n)
