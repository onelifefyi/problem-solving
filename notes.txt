1: 25/04/2020: Damn!! I can't code at night, anyway I tried to solve codeforces 700 question and inderstood the approach too but I have problem coding at night I feel sleepy.
                P.S: It's not even 11:00pm yet.
2: 28/04/2020: Taking very huge as input on int var = Scanner.nextInt() won't work (Input mismatch)
                I should be using long var = Scanner.nextLong()
3: 07/05/2020: I understimated the problem https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1230/A.... Solved in CPP
                Still Incomplete
4: 08/05/2020: Completed the last days problem: tip for Coding Questions if it is small then hardcode it 
                eg for last problem only 4 times iteration was required, hence used 4 loops
5: 12/05/2020: Solved a problem (see AbAb), It first felt like, I won't be able to solve this problem, but then I started thinking and took pencil and paper to figure out the 
                solution. Finally it worked!! (first try!! although it's thanks to test cases (see note))
                Note: Always check the range, cos sometimes we need to use long instead of int
6: 13/05/2020: BDcake.java (3rd of the day) Seemed complex, had problem taking inputs(chars). Finally solved, I had to derive a formula for # of combinations to solve this. 
	       (Again: Pen and Paper works!! (Formula))
		- StonePile (Always! Always!!!) run on given test case example! Helps understand question better
7: 14/05/2020: I thought CodeForces is conspiring against me. PrimeMinister problem. N.B Always double check the expected output format!!! (Good Question though)
		- I participated in first codeforces competition (div3). Solved 2/6 (almost +1). It was a good experience. 
8: 17/05/2020: A good implementation that I did for a for loop (lol for-for). Checkout GameOutput (Problem 157A). I can see myself getting abit better
9: 21/05/2020: Solved a problem see candy2. It didn't got accepted b'cos time out but I found a more accurate solution. 
		- Remember in CP time matter a lot.
10: 23/05/2020: Prod1: (1206B). Logic correct, tested(all ok), forgot long range and and and..... also I waas multiplying really long numbers which caused it to go out of range too!
		Hence had to change approach, (prev I was multiplying long, now I just counted the no of -vs insted of multiplying it). Good One! Took around 90 mins to fix!!!
