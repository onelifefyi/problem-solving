Contest:  Codeforces Round #644 (Div. 3)
https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/77796


Solved A,B,C & E (4 out of 8).

*D took a lot of time (time out error), couldn't find a way to get highest prime factor of a num. It a lot of time.

*E: I didn't check the input format properly. It was a matrix but the numbers were of the form:
		1110
		0001
		...
So, the problem was I took it as nextInt(), but it took the entire 1110 as a int! So had to change stuffs and took a lot 
	of time to figure out that

* Didn't got enough time to check F, G and H

NOTE: Time is an important factor, if I can't figure out a problem, I should move ahead. Maybe alloting time for each question might work.
