I was able to succesfully solve only one problem 'B' that's soo devastating!! :(

Analysis:
+++ NOOOOOOOOOO: I missed C with only because of 1 '=' sign!!!!!!!!!! <See line 16 :(>

Man, I was so frustated while solving that what was missing!!! I was quite sure that I had a correct solution!
I should have calmly checked it once more!!!
